From Spencer: Hey everybody! I've been keeping this on the down low today but now I have to say it: today is my birthday. The reason I have to say it is because my parents sent me a cake thru Bon a petite, and I want to share it with as many people as I can. I was planning to maybe try to cut it in my room (213) around 11:00 or 11:30. If you'd like some feel free to tell me via the chat! Hope you can come!

Dex is in too!
Dec 11, 4:58pm

Connor Valenti
Sweet! The question now becomes: what type do we order...and from where?
Dec 11, 5:06pm

Anne McEvoy
At Papa John's, which I know you're opposed to on principle, Connor, you can get two large one topping pizzas and a two liter of soda for 19.99. For 8 p
eople, we would do probably do that deal twice.

B-Sizzle
5 bucks per person. Plus a little tip. Not bad. But didnt we find out italian pie shoppe is actually cheaper with our discount?

Connor Valenti
Ooh. That is quite the tempting deal. But we also might have more than 8. I know Noah is in an exam right now but he expressed interest earlier and wasn't john still considering?

Bridget Gustafson
Even with 10, 4 pizzas is probably enough, right? And Ben, how much cheaper? is delivery worth the extra money?

B-Sizzle
John isnt in. Bridget, i'll look it up and get back to you in a few.

Connor Valenti
Depends on how much everyone is planning to eat but yeah it probably will be.

Bridget Gustafson
Fair point.

B-Sizzle
Ya, it looks like papa j's is going to be cheaper

Connor Valenti
Yes it does^

Anne McEvoy
 1
Mara's in.

Connor Valenti
Should we consider getting more than 4 pizzas then?

Bridget Gustafson
How big are they?

Connor Valenti
14 inches

Anne McEvoy
Do you want to do 6?

B-Sizzle
Connor aint back till seven

Bridget Gustafson
Funny. She meant pizzas.

Anne McEvoy
Pizzas, Ben.

Bridget Gustafson
That would still only be about $6 per person. Sounds decent.

Talia Young
 1
Can I be in too? Does that complicate the numbers too much?

Connor Valenti
I'm usually in favor of ordering more because we can always save leftovers if we have them or we can be generous people and give them away. Up to us. And no Talia not at all. You're welcome to join

Talia Young
(:

Anne McEvoy
So who has passionate feelings about toppings?

Connor Valenti
There should be at least 2 just cheese pizzas

B-Sizzle
 1
I have no passion

Anne McEvoy
 2
It'll probably be more like three cheeses. Because no one doesn't eat cheese.

Connor Valenti
Even better!

Anne McEvoy
What about sodas?

Connor Valenti
Papa John's only has pepsi products (sorry Anne) so one pepsi, one sierra mist and one mountain dew or orange?

Anne McEvoy
Okay, so if no one has any pizza opinions, get like 4 cheese and 2 pepperoni.
Dec 11, 5:45pm

Anne McEvoy
 1
Emily Sanford is in.

Connor Valenti
Is everyone down with 4 cheese and 2 pepperoni?

Ellen Ullerup
Sounds good!

B-Sizzle
I'm down

Connor Valenti
Okay sweet. what about soda opinions? Our options are Dr. Pepper, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist, and Orange. We get to pick three.

Anne McEvoy
I vote Pepsi. Emily votes orange or Sierra Mist.

Connor Valenti
Well just do one of each of those three unless someone has a dying passion for mountain dew or dr. pepper
Dec 11, 6:05pm

Connor Valenti
Sooo. Who wants to place the order?
Dec 11, 6:15pm

Anne McEvoy
I'll do it if I can put your name and phone number, Connor. Also, we have to have enough cash to pay for it, because I can't put it on my card.

Connor Valenti
I can put it on my card if everyone wants to give me cash for it.

Anne McEvoy
 1
Sure. Do you want to order it online then?

Bridget Gustafson
Shoot. I just realized I don't have cash. Can I pay you back tomorrow, Connor?

Noah Nieting
Order, Connor, order!

Connor Valenti
Yeah but if I put in the order now then I need to put down someone else's phone number in case I'm not back from work by the time it arrives. And yes Bridget that's fine.

Anne McEvoy
If you order online, you have to go to "Special Offers" and it's he one called "Free 2 Liter." It's $19.99.

Connor Valenti
Yep yep I see it. Ben or Noah or Spencer. Are you guys in a position to go get the pizza when it gets here?

B-Sizzle
I can do it

Connor Valenti
Alright I'm gonna put down your phone number then and place the order now.

Emily Sanford
Yay food

B-Sizzle
Sweet

Bridget Gustafson
Thanks, Connor!

Connor Valenti
How much should I tip? Also ben be prepared to be called Connor when they call you.

Emily Sanford
If its $20 then tip 20% = $4

Connor Valenti
But it's three orders of 20. Does that mean I have to tip 12? Cause that seems like a lot

B-Sizzle
 1
I will be Connor.

Emily Sanford
Yes.

Connor Valenti
Alrighty. The order has been placed. I hope you're all hungry! Also we kinda need a location...

B-Sizzle

B-Sizzle
It shouldnt be broty lounge.

Spencer Moor
How about that nice basement room?
Do wee need to reserve that though?

Anne McEvoy
I second that, Spencer, but I have no idea if we have to reserve it.

Spencer Moor
I'll run down and read the sign. One sec

Emily Sanford
Yay thanks Spencer

Spencer Moor
We could potentially use it...but I saw some persons stuff in there. So some one must be using it to study

Ryan Dugan
Let's all take this moment to pretend we don't have the times of our lives at my parties.

Connor Valenti
Pretend. Acknowledge. I think they're interchangeable.

Ryan Dugan
Someone won't make the guest list next semester.
Jan 11, 11:23pm

Connor Valenti
Pretty sure everyone in Ryan's contacts doesn't count as a guest list

Emily Sanford

B-Sizzle
True. Have they at least communicated with you?
Jan 16, 1:51pm

Connor Valenti
Yeah the procedure before me got delayed because of an emergency at another hospital so it's looking more like I'm going to have to stay the night.

Connor Valenti
Yeah I've got my IV in and everything. Just waiting to be knocked out.
Jan 16, 2:13pm

Emily Sanford

Watch House while you're waiting. That's my personal fav pre-surgery show

Jan 23, 6:19pm

Connor Valenti
For those of you who don't know, my procedure wasn't successful and the plan was to send me back to school on medication and do another procedure this summer to permanently fix the problem. I saw a new cardiologist today and he doesn't believe it's safe for me to return to school before this so I will be going back into surgery Monday. This means I will be missing this first week of school :(

Henry Fender
Connor - I'm so sorry

John Gla$gow
Oh no! I pray it goes well Connor!

B-Sizzle
We'll miss you connor, but i'm happy that you'll come back knowing you're safe. Always praying.
Jan 23, 6:27pm

Connor Valenti

Emily Sanford
My dad's heart went 295 when he had a similar thing so I thought it was worth a shot lol

Henry Fender
Wow! That's really high!

Bridget Gustafson
Why thank you! I'd like to thank my friend Connor "Man with the plan" Valenti for his inspiration

Connor Valenti
Did he really? Wow. Maybe it is possible to go that high then. I was at rest so maybe if I'd been running or something I would've hit 300.

Feb 1, 5:21pm

Noah Nieting
What's the plan for dinner?

Ned Read
6:00?

Spencer Moor
If anyone wants to eat out there's always the Blue Door. But it's probably too much of a walk right?

B-Sizzle
How far is it?

Ryan Dugan
It's like a 15 minute walk.

Noah Nieting
About a mile.

Spencer Moor
It doesn't sound bad to me, but I'm sure it's not appealing to everyone

Ryan Dugan
Do you wanna go at 6:30/6:45?

B-Sizzle
I'd be down, if everyone else wants to walk that far. We can always go somewhere else...

Noah Nieting
I'm up for anywhere.

Spencer Moor
Okie doke

Ned Read
What kind of restaurant is the blue door?

Spencer Moor
Burgers, and SOUPS I'm sure as well ;)

Ryan Dugan

May I suggest the Italian Pie Shoppe?

Spencer Moor
That'd be easier

B-Sizzle
I do like pie. And i think they have pizza there too!

Spencer Moor
How about Ryan and Noah?
Feb 1, 5:47pm

Ryan Dugan
Hmmm maybe....it would be more expensive.

Noah Nieting
It would be comparable to going to Pad Thai, price-wise. Less is surely possible too.

Ryan Dugan

Let's do it. Meet in the lounge at 6:30?

Noah Nieting

John Gla$gow
I already ate :-)

Ned Read
What a scrub

Connor Valenti
Anybody here yet?

John Gla$gow
Lol
Feb 18, 10:55am

Connor Valenti
Someone should go to the library and look at To Kill A Mockingbird for the golden condom.

Ned Read
Why there?

Connor Valenti
The second clue is "Harper's Book". The author of to kill a mockingbird is Harper Lee. Also the first clue was "Consent is Mac" and there was a rape accusation in that book

Anne McEvoy
Connor, you should do it.

Connor Valenti
I would if I weren't at work right now.
I'll go at noon but it could be gone by then.
Feb 18, 11:20am

Ryan Dugan
Hmmm it doesn't seem to be on the library database. I'm here now.

Connor Valenti
That's what they want you to think.
Look up Molly Harper. See if that returns anything.

Bridget Gustafson
Emily and I are on it

Connor Valenti
Haha I can't join the search for a half hour :(

Bridget Gustafson
Are we looking for a clue? Or the actual thing?

Connor Valenti
The actual thing I would presume.

Emily Roebuck 2

Bridget and I looked at this call number and found two books but no clue

B-Sizzle
Maybe it's in the books themselves

Connor Valenti
Possible^

Emily Roebuck 2
We flipped through the pages pretty thoroughly

Connor Valenti
We're these books copies of To Kill A Mockingbird?

Bridget Gustafson
...we looked in the books...that was defs the point.
Yes

Connor Valenti
Does the library have any books by Molly Harper?

Bridget Gustafson
We should also maybe check books about to kill a mockingbird

Connor Valenti
That's an idea^

Ned Read
Could it be about something that happened in the book.
?

Connor Valenti
The first clue was consent is mac. And there is a rape trial in the book.

Ned Read
And then connect something else in the book to Macalester

Bridget Gustafson
Like a big ham!

Ryan Dugan
I checked a few books by a Harper, but no dice. Maybe harper's atlas? It's probably just a conceptual clue, yeah.

Connor Valenti
A big ham...?

B-Sizzle
My exact same question

Emily Roebuck 2
Harper publishing is a book agency?

Spencer Moor
Lunch?

B-Sizzle
Haha spencer

Ryan Dugan
 1
No Spencer, not now!

Spencer Moor
 2
Lunch (saddened tone)

Connor Valenti
Haha maybe at like 12:15 or 12:30? I'd like to run by the library after work just for a few

Ned Read
Harpercollins is a publisher

Connor Valenti
Yeah that's what Emily said. I'm looking at their authors right nkw

Emily Roebuck 2
Yeah I had only ever heard of Harper Collins....Emily is the only one who's heard of just Harper, so maybe double check that "fact" :P

Connor Valenti
When you search harper publisher it redirects to HarperCollins
Lol Sarah Palin is one of their authors
Feb 18, 11:53am

Connor Valenti
I feel like it has to have something to do with To Kill A Mockingbird because the clue was "Harper's Book" and that was the only book she wrote.

Bridget Gustafson
It could just be another book about rape

B-Sizzle
Ya, but it still has to connect to Harper.

Connor Valenti
It could not be in a book at all. Is there any reference to the book anywhere on campus?

Spencer Moor
Lunch?

Connor Valenti
Yeah I guess let's just have lunch now

Bridget Gustafson
I know, Ben. Harpercollins. I do think to kill a mockingbird is more likely
I can't think of any iconic scenes that relate to places at macalester

Spencer Moor
Lunch?

Connor Valenti
I'm coming Spencer!

Spencer Moor
I'm sitting by the tv

Connor Valenti
Lies!
Feb 18, 12:15pm

What does a house manager do John?

Bridget Gustafson
They organize ushering?
And they sit in the box office a lot

(Sorry my name isn't really John)

Ushers are part of it
From what I know they open/close the house at the beginning/ends of shows. And maintain the seating section of the theatre. That's what I know
There's more to it than that but that's what I can think of atm
April 14, 5:00pm

J-Doge
But yes if anyone is even slightly interested don't hesitate to ask we really need someone

Babies!!!! So, as I got to the airport, the guy who checked me in told me that since I don't have an actual baby I'd have to pay $150 to check Strolley. I called my uncle and told him about it and he told me to pay everything I need to, as long as I bring Strolley to Brazil. My uncle is fucking crazy!!!

Carter D'Angelo

I am so confused. But seeing as you are supreme baby, I think that should count.

Marcio Porto
And that's only until Miami. I'll have to pay extra again from Miami to Brazil haha

Ned Read

Just find an actual baby

Marcio Porto
I need a baby with me at all times though
Even on the plane
The guy said it'd be free if there was a baby in Strolley. But since there isn't any, I have to pay 
I mean. My uncle is paying. So I don't really care

It's raining so much outside we can't really go anywhere  also really fucking bad thunderstorms. The TV keeps losing signal because of the rain and there was a power outage a couple minutes ago. Everyone's been advised not to leave. So me and Strollie are just cuddling and talking in bed

I can imagine strollie is more of a listener

I'd say so. I do most of the talking. Maybe all of it. But it doesn't matter. Love is above everything

Juice Pouch
Wow this relationship is moving fast. Do you think she's the one?
May 15, 3:30pm

Marcio Porto
Too soon to tell. I'm trying to think of this more as a summer fling since we will split ways when we get to Brazil. She wi live in Manaus and I will stay in my city. Maybe one day our paths cross again. But for now, our relationship can't go much further
In retrospect then, love was the wrong word to use haha

There are some pictures and I'll send them later
I'll start recording tomorrow
I'll record some today. But not that many... 
Hey, just out of curiosity, are they showing the party in other Brazilian cities up there in the US?
They are showing it here and there's so many people on the streets it's insane

Marcio...that's about as damn close as it can get. I would consider Brazil pretty lucky today

Marcio Porto
I won't comment on that. The ref was horrible today. I am not saying we played well because we didn't. But the ref almost cost us the game
There's a lot to fix for the next game, but we deserved the win anyway
Plus Chile is a great team. It was supposed to be a hard game. Just not this hard...

Hey everyone. If you haven't heard about it already, you quite possibly will tomorrow but there was an unarmed teenager shot and killed by police officers the other day in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis. Since then, riots and looting have erupted and chaos has ensued. There's a lot of confusion out there now which I'm sure will be cleared up later. For now, no the riots are not near where i live but they are very near to my grandparents.
Nevertheless it's a sad day here in St. Louis and I hope things calm down soon

Hello, friends. Does anyone have an HP laptop and want to see if their charger will charge my computer? Alternatively, do any of you Comp Sci majors have any idea how to fix my charger that I can't get to charge my computer?

Thats not a comp sci problem, thats a physics/engineering problem

You should talk to Ned.
ITS usually does this stuff.
They may even have spare chargers

I may be able to look at the charger, ITS has only Dell chargers

I tried a Dell charger from the library. It lights up the little "charging" light but says that it's not charging.

Storm Warning Update: The Twin Cities metro area is now believed to be along a line to receive over 6 inches, the heaviest amounts are due to fall just north of the cities. Because of the unpredictably of the weather the true amount we will get is anywhere between 0-14 inches. Regardless of amount the NWS had stated this will be a very hazardous storm, travel is discouraged. A few power outages are to be expected.

The worst part of the storm is expected to arrive in the early afternoon Monday
